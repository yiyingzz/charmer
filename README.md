## Description

This project was originally a pair programming project called "Food & A Flick", made with [Keil Martin](https://github.com/keilmart) for [Juno College](https://junocollege.com)'s Web Development Immersive bootcamp. After the bootcamp ended, I continued working on it to add some features & tweaks that we never got to in the original project due to time constraints.

## Functionality

Users are able to:

- Search for recipes by typing in a food item, dish, or cuisine type
- Search for movies by genre

## Made with

- HTML5
- CSS3, Sass
- JavaScript, jQuery
- Pair Programming
- VS Code
- [Animate on scroll](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
- [TheMovieDB](themoviedb.org) & [Spoonacular](spoonacular.com) APIs
